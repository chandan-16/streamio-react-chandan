Debouncing :

typing slow = 200ms
type fast = 30ms


Performances :
- iphone pro max = 14 letter's * 1000 = 14,000
- with debouncing = 3 API Calls * 1000 = 3000


Debouncing with 200ms
- if difference between 2 key strokes is "200ms" - Decline the api call
<200ms make an api call (migh need suggestions)

Cache : 
time complexity to search in the array = 0(n);
time complexity to search in object = 0(1);

array.indexOf();

[i, ip, iph, ipho, iphon, iphone]

new Map();

Understood the Web socket and API Polling concept and applying in my app
